use demo_agents.cljs as the foundation for a more ambitious simulations
rename asker and teller agents to questioner and answerer agents
the purpose of the simulation is to evolve an information economy/ecololgy where cooperation between simple agents evolves from competitive pressures.
the simulation uses three kinds of agents: queston agents (QA) and answer agents (AA) and horses-mouth agents (HA).
QAs keep track of which AAs are more likely to give correct answers
AAs have the ability to answer certain kinds of questions.
Some AAs have the ability to ask other AAs for answers and compose
AAs learn how to answers by asking other agents for 
for the prototype of this simulation we will use the following constraints:
    tokens will not be used 
    there will be one HA one QA and six AAs.
    the QA has a list of questions - for the prototyoe the questions are simple math s-expressions (+ - * /)
    questions are Clojure s-expressions, answers can be numbers, strings or s-expressions
    the QA iterates through the question list, posting the questions to all of the AAs.
    each AA has the ability to answer some questions as specified by it's "{:allow allowed-symbols}" parameter
    each AA will process the question and submit it's answer to the QA if it has the ability needed to do so.
    the QA will select one of the answers from those submitted by the AAs.
    when a QA accepts an answer from an AA the QA can verify the answer by sending the question to the HA.
        the HA agent has the ability to answer all questions correctly
    

    we want the AA and QA agents to build a model of themselves and other agents.
    some AAs can only answer specific kinds of questions like + or -
    some AAs have the ability to ask other AAs to provide partial answers
